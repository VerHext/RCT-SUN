# RCT-SUN is a client library for the RCT power inverter

```
npm install rct-sun
```

Statistics is great. This libary allows to connect with nodejs to the rct power inverter.
And to query values via commands. The transport is based on a net moduel (TCPSocket). In this libary it is possible to send any "read" request.

It is officially also possible to make settings on the inverter, but this function is not recommended and is not supported by this lib.
